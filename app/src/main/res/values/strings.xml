    <string name="shopaboutstory">I remember those old-fashioned barber shops, the ones where everyone was welcome. You could hear stories about people who made it to the top, never just a place to get your haircut, rather, filled with conversation and good memories. I spent most of my childhood in one. When life threw-out and the day would go wrong, the barber shop was a place that made me feel strong - a place where everyone shares an experience. It\'s places like this, I love the most.</string>
